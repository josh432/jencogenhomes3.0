      My job is to minimize pain points, educate you, and protect you during the
      buying or selling process. I will help you develop a strategic plan and
      back it up with my strong negotiation skills, unparalleled accessibility,
      and local market expertise.

      I’m the daughter and granddaughter of builders, so it’s no surprise I
      pursued real estate. Community service is also in my family’s D.N.A. I
      started volunteering in high school and have never stopped-- my latest
      volunteer gigs are as Parents Association President, and Trustee at my
      kids’ schools.

      Before kids, husband, and a dog, I was lucky enough to work in and travel
      to many parts of the world. I worked at Cisco Systems providing service,
      solo, to their largest corporate customer. I have an English degree from
      Tufts University, and a M.B.A. (in marketing and negotiation) from The
      American Graduate School of International Management. My background has
      led me to be resourceful, well educated, and adept at navigating the East
      Bay Market.
